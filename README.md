# Mill-Application
A simple application used to manage operations in our home grinding mill. It is used by my aunt to tell if the mill operator is using the mill correctly and is submitting the correct amount of money

The operator takes a meter reading at the beginning of the day and another after finishing his shift. He also records the number of buckets milled.

When aunt fills that information in the application form, it saves the data and deduces the expected amount of money, deficit if there is any and may give instructions to the operator.

Metrics of importance include average electricity usage of one bucket and its variance, amount of money generated per bucket and total money
