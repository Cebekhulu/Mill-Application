# Mill-Application
A simple application used to manage operations in our home grinding mill. It is used by my aunt to tell if the mill operator is using the mill correctly and is submitting the correct amount of money

The operator takes a meter reading at the beginning of the day and another after finishing his shift. He also records the number of buckets milled.

When aunt enters that information in the application form, it tells her information that she needs to know regarding usage of the mill and what information she may need to tell the operator. For example, she will be informed if money is missing or if the operator is too quick to turn off the machine.

The application saves the data and deduces the expected amount of money, deficit if there is any and will give instructions on how the operator should remedy their actions if any error is noticed.

Metrics of importance include average electricity usage of one bucket and its variance, amount of money generated per unit of electricity and total money earned.
